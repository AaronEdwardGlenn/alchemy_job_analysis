Inspire by example. We challenge each other to risk temporary setbacks in pursuit of lasting progress.
About The Good

A little about our “Why”.

At The Good we know what ecommerce leaders really want is to have a website that produces a lot more revenue from their existing traffic. In order to do that, they need to convert more of their website visitors into buyers. The problem is, they don't know how to get their conversion rate to the next level which makes them feel frustrated and stuck.

We believe every ecommerce leader deserves a clear path that helps them realize their website's true conversion potential. We understand how challenging it can be to take an existing website to its next level, which is why for almost 10 years we have been helping ecommerce sites increase their conversion rates without the need to increase traffic.

In fact, we've written the book on it: Stop Marketing, Start Selling.

We are proud to be a certified B-Corporation.

B Corps are a new type of company that uses the power of business to solve social and environmental problems. While The Good has sought to hold ourselves to higher standards as a matter of principle, the certification has helped to add another layer of outside accountability and transparency. B-Corp has evaluated how our practices impact our employees, their community, the environment, and our customers. To learn more about our certification, check out The Good's B Corp profile.

88,DevOps Engineer,$52K-$98K (Glassdoor est.),"Background


We don't just build custom software, we are a technology partner who creates lasting relationships that help our customers grow their business. We work with innovative companies to create custom applications that will unlock growth, streamline processes, and ensure scalability. We collaborate with our clients on a daily basis to ensure we are driving value at multiple levels.

We have been in business for over 15 years and employ more than 175 people from our headquarters in Portland, and across our satellite offices in San Diego, Austin, Jacksonville Beach, Ashland, and Vietnam. For six years running we continue to be honored as one of Inc. 5000's and Portland Business Journal's Fastest Growing Private Companies, and there is little sign of slowing down!

Why this Role? Why Now?


For 15 years we have focused on providing the highest value software applications to our clients. Because of our growth and diversification of products, we are expanding our DevOps and SRE team to provide increased visibility and stability for our customers. We believe that you can't improve what you can't measure, so we ask that every member of the AltSource family have a bias toward data, performance metrics, and OKR's in order to push the boundaries of how we are defining success and value in light of the shifting business needs and priorities of our customers. Our DevOps and SRE team provides a unique benefit to both IT operations and software development teams. Not only can they drive increased reliability for systems in production but they also increase the value of IT, support and Dev teams by allowing them to spend less time working on support escalations, allowing more time to build new features and services.


Responsibilities:

Develop, maintain and support client technical infrastructure, hardware and system software components
Perform installation, maintenance and support of application system software/hardware and client user support
Configure, debug and support client line of business infrastructure platforms
Perform high-level root-cause analysis for service interruption recovery and create preventative measures
Monitor and test application performance for potential bottlenecks, identify possible solutions, and work with developers to implement those fixes
Document tribal knowledge
Be part of an on-call rotation for incident response
Find areas to offer recommendations for enhanced visibility and automation of the SRE function and competency
The Big 5:

Computer Science degree
3+ years in DevOps or Site Reliability role in Software
MUST HAVE: proficiency in Windows/.NET/SQL stack
Progressive work experience due to proven track record of high performance
Alignment with our company's core values
Feathers in the Cap:

ApplicationMonitoring (NewRelic or AppD), Configuration Management (Chef/Puppet/Ansible) are nice, RabbitMQ/ELK/Redis and TeamCity/OD are pluses as well
The Support You Deserve:


We are very proud of the high employee retention and work culture we have built here at AltSource, but we never allow ourselves to feel we have arrived. We believe hiring uniquely talented individuals with diverse backgrounds and life experiences is the only way to continue to create a compelling product and service to our customers. While we offer amazing perks like a beautifully appointed headquarters in SE Portland, replete with ping pong, locker/bike rooms, catered breakfasts/lunches and plenty of Kombucha and cold brew, we don't believe that those things are the foundation of true, substantive culture.

At our heart, we are a group of builders and doers who are obsessed with seeking a better way to drive client value. We come to work each day, braving the freeway traffic or crowded MAX cars because we actively choose a career that pushes us outside our comfort zone and allows us to be intimately involved with solutions that solve real business problems, experiencing personal growth and development rare to most organizations of our size. Because we seek high performance and high accountability, we offer competitive wage and benefit packages including paid medical and dental for all employees, and a 401k plan that rewards dedication and loyalty.

We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 40 employees and $25M annual revenue over the past five years.

As a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering.

We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy -- it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.

We are seeking an ambitious and nice lead software engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team's growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers.

We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack.

During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company.

Job Description:
The Office of Information Services (OIS) is a shared service provider for the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and Department of Human Services (DHS). OIS provides the technology systems and services that support more than 11,000 OHA and DHS agency staff at local offices and facilities around the state. These systems and services help the two agencies determine client service program eligibility; provide medical, housing, food and job assistance; provide addiction, mental health, vocational and rehabilitative services; protect children, seniors and people with physical and/or developmental disabilities; process claims and benefits; manage provider licensing and state hospital facilities; and promote and protect the state public health.
The current Vaccination Assessment, Record-Keeping and Reporting (VARR) process in Oregon involves 34 local public health authorities (LPHAs), and over 3,300 schools and children's facilities, helping to protect more than 650,000 children. Though the current process has been able to minimize the spread of disease, the current systems used, and time expended by participants on the process, are unsustainable. Antiquated technology and the growing complexity of vaccine requirements and other school immunization regulations require a new solution.
A solution in the form of SMILER, the School Module Immunization Law and Electronic Reporting, as a centralized system used to assess student immunization data and generation of required reports and exclusion letters, is proposed. SMILER introduces a new ""system of record"" and includes query capability to the most complete electronic source of immunization data, ALERT IIS. Through a direct interface, the abundant data of ALERT IIS will be leveraged, manual assessment and reporting steps are mostly eliminated, as is the reliance on Certificate of Immunization Status (CIS) forms to establish student immunization records for assessment.
Work is to be conducted on site in Portland, Oregon.
Work schedule is typically Monday - Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM Pacific Standard Time.
Interviews will be conducted on site in Portland, OR or via Skype. Interview times will reflect PST.
RequiredÂknowledge and experience:
Core, JIRA, Azure DevOps (ADOS), GIT, MSSQL Server
Experience in architecture based on a service API, RESTful web service calls, and a single-page-application (SPA) client using a Microsoft .NET Core (version 3.1 or higher) and Angular (version 8 or higher) based technology framework
Ability to learn, understand and use the agreed to Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
Strong working knowledge of modern relational database design, modeling, manipulation
Experience with performance monitoring and tuning techniques
Skill in testing, troubleshooting and technical problem solving
Ability to work cooperatively in a team environment, as well as able to work independently

We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we’re a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy -- it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.

We are seeking an ambitious and nice lead software engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team’s growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate.

The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack.

During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company.

We have been a fully remote workforce for seven years and have been recognized as a leader in remote working. Our employees have continued working with minimal disruption and our hiring efforts are proceeding as planned. By continuing to help our customers bring their special memories to life, we hope to bring smiles to their faces during these stressful times.

Collage.com's mission is to make custom products easy for everyone. We strive to do this by providing superior software and excellent customer service. We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 60 employees and $50M annual revenue since 2013.

As a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com's co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy -- it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.

We are seeking an ambitious and nice senior front-end engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team's growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.

188,Senior Full-stack Software Engineer (Remote),$66K-$108K (Glassdoor est.),"Collage.com is fortunate to remain open for business during the COVID-19 crisis and to see demand for our product increase. We have been a fully remote workforce for seven years and have been recognized as a leader in remote working. Our employees have continued working with minimal disruption and our hiring efforts are proceeding as planned. By continuing to help our customers bring their special memories to life, we hope to bring smiles to their faces during these stressful times.

Collage.com's mission is to make custom products easy for everyone. We strive to do this by providing superior software and excellent customer service. We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 60 employees and $50M annual revenue since 2013.

As a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com's co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy -- it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.

We are seeking an ambitious and nice senior full-stack engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team's growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.

The Interview Process


The goal of our interview process is to identify people who will be a good fit for our company and are talented, ambitious engineers. Because you will be working remotely, all of our interviews are done over the phone in close succession to move through the process quickly. We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills.

We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack.

During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company. We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you'd like to meet before accepting an offer.

As a service-based company, we pride ourselves on the agility and speed with which we can bring new products and applications to-market for our customers.

With the support of experienced Project and Product Management, you will be owning the technical excellence of custom software solutions delivered across a variety of business areas and domains. You will work directly with stakeholders at the client-level, as well as fast-moving, business-driven internal resources in collaboration towards a common goal.


Responsibilities:

Design complex technical solutions that span multiple teams and business areas that meet the customer's needs, on time and on budget
Ensure code quality with code reviews, technical design reviews, and patterns and practice standards for a team of junior and mid-level engineers

We are insanely proud of the high employee retention and work culture we have built here at AltSource, but we never allow ourselves to feel we have arrived. We believe hiring uniquely talented individuals with diverse backgrounds and life experiences is the only way to continue to create a compelling product and service to our customers. While we offer amazing perks like a beautifully appointed headquarters in SE Portland, replete with ping pong, locker/bike rooms, catered breakfasts/lunches and enough Kombucha to fill the Mt. Tabor Reservoir, we don't believe that those things are the foundation of true, substantive culture.

At our heart, we are a group of builders and doers who are obsessed with seeking a better way to drive client value. We come to work each day choosing a career that pushes us outside our comfort zone and allows us to experience personal growth and development rare to most organizations.

204,Senior Full-stack Software Engineer,$66K-$108K (Glassdoor est.),"Collage.com is fortunate to remain open for business during the COVID-19 crisis and to see demand for our product increase. We have been a fully remote workforce for seven years and have been recognized as a leader in remote working. Our employees have continued working with minimal disruption and our hiring efforts are proceeding as planned. By continuing to help our customers bring their special memories to life, we hope to bring smiles to their faces during these stressful times.

Collage.com’s mission is to make custom products easy for everyone. We strive to do this by providing superior software and excellent customer service. We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 60 employees and $50M annual revenue since 2013.

As a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com’s co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we’re a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy -- it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.

We are seeking an ambitious and nice senior full-stack engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team’s growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.

Responsibilities
Write and maintain front-end JavaScript code as part of a mobile-first web application, including UI components and state management logic, as well as back-end PHP and front-end network communication code (back end is approximately 10% of work).
Make decisions about code design, architecture, and refactoring to balance technical debt against delivering functionality.
Plan and lead testing for complex projects.
Review code and mentor other engineers.
Provide time estimates and participate in agile development.
Review specifications and work with PMs to implement lean methodology.
Required Qualifications
Experience implementing and testing advanced JavaScript code on a team as part of a production web or mobile application
Practical experience with MV* architecture (such as Backbone, Vue, React + Redux/Mobx, etc.), unidirectional data flow, and minimal class/object interfaces
Spatial/geometric reasoning ability -- for rendering, animation, and image manipulation
Ability to quickly understand and work with unfamiliar complex code
Pro-active and clear communication is essential for this remote work position
Benefits and Perks
Working from home makes it easier to focus on results and develop professionally while spending less time commuting. (See our opinion piece on perks and work-life balance at mlive.com.)
401(k) plan, home internet reimbursement, and $3,000 / year in free Collage.com products plus employee discount for friends and family.
Collage.com pays 100% of the premium for full health, vision and dental insurance coverage for you and your family in a high-quality Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plan.
Flexible work schedule and unlimited vacation policy (work hard and take time when you need it).
We’ll pay for any computer and home office equipment (within reason) that will help you work better.
The Interview Process


The goal of our interview process is to identify people who will be a good fit for our company and are talented, ambitious engineers. Because you will be working remotely, all of our interviews are done over the phone in close succession to move through the process quickly. We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills.

We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack.

During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company. We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you’d like to meet before accepting an offer.

Team

Most of our team chooses to work over 40 hours often. Not because of unrealistic deadlines, but rather because we love what we do and strive to be the best. We choose to work hard because it is rewarding. Our contributions are acknowledged by our managers, and our successes praised. We empower our team to make decisions rather than asking for approval. Micromanaging doesn't exist here. We encourage taking risks and sometimes failing because we understand that is how we get better.

We believe our philosophy builds trust, encourages growth, and drives new ideas. We believe in each other. If you're the type of person that has always looked at things and wished you had the autonomy to fix them without red tape, knowing you have a team that will back you up, this might be the place for you.
